Jupyter notebooks and R Markdown documents for working with SKOPE services

The various Jupyter notebooks and R Markdown documents in this repository aim to serve the following purposes:

**1. Verify deployments.**  Make it easy to verify that a set of SKOPE services is deployed correctly and that the services are behaving as designed. Confirm that each of the datasets meant to be made available through the SKOPE services is in fact accessible, iss associated with correct metadata, and works as expected with each service.

**2. Document services.** Demonstrate the function of each SKOPE service in a way that clealy documents the protocol for working with it.  These notebooks are targeted at developers of applications that employ SKOPE services.

**3. Enable reproducible research.** Provide an alternative to using the SKOPE web interface for discovering, viewing, and analyzing data sets available through the SKOPE sevices.  The aim is to make all of the capabilities of the standard SKOPE web interface available via Jupyter notebooks and R Markdown documents. Ultimately these notebooks will serve as starting points for carrying out reproducible data analyses using SKOPE data sets and services, and sharing them with others.
